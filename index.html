[Chapter  1: Getting my Magical Powers]
"The day has finally come. We will be getting our magical powers!!!"

"Shut up or I will kill you."

Said my bully, Chris. He is a bad guy to me and we were born in the same year.

"Whahaaad......Sorry, chris!!"

"Hmph………"

Then he walked away like a frickin' idiot. Oops, I probably shouldn't be saying that!

"Huh? Did you say something, gullible???", said Chris

"N---no..."

“Yeah. Seems Legit”

And then he walked away again…………. LIKE A FRICKIN’ IDIOT!!

“I SWEAR I AM GONNA GET BETTER MAGIC THAN YOU, FRICKIN’ CHRIS” is what I said when chris was really far away.

“SHUT UP GULLIBLE!!!”, chris replied.
Oh yeah! Chris calls me Gullible to make fun of me. Lol that is a really bad name to be honest!

Then me and Chris finally made it to the place of the saints to get our magics. I went up to the registration place.

“Show me your hand. “

Said the receptionist.

“Oh. Ok!”

Then she scanned my hand from some kind of scanner and said this: 

“Your number is 419”

“HOLY SHOOT! 419???? THAT WAS TOO CLOSE TO 420!!!” is what I said.

“Now you can go inside!”

“Thank you!”

Then I went inside the huge castle where we would be getting our magics.

“WELCOME MY DISCIPLES!!”

Said the saint.

(SILENCE)

Everyone remained silent.

“Stay as silent as you want to be but today is the day YOU will be getting your MAGICS!!!”

(SILENCE)

Everyone remained silent again.

“Ok. Without further I do. Let’s get straight into getting your magics!!!”

“YAAAYYYYYY!!!”

Shouted the croud the first time!

“Sheesh! Finally you guys stood up! Now Participant No. 1”

Said the saint again!

The participant No. 1 got his magic which was apparently fire power

(Skip upto Participant No. 419)

“Ugh! It’s finally my turn!”

Is what I said.

“Now. Give me your hand.”

“Sure!”

Then I handed him my hand (not literally)

“Hmm…. HOLY SHOOT!!”

“Huh, What happened? Saint???”

“Ugh. It’s nothing really. It’s just that you are not normal for this world. I mean… not weak.. but strong”

“What? I am strong you mean?”

“You heard it right! Here you go your magic! Now. Test what it really is!”

“GOT IT!!”

Then I got my hand up to the sky and focused my energy there.

“HAAAaaa! WHAT THE HECK!!”

Then my hand threw blue flames!

“WOOOOAAAHHHH! THAT’S A GREAT MAGIC.”

Is what I said.

“If you think that is a great power. Then you got huge things to learn!”

“I know that. But it is a great power in the grand scheme of things!”

“I guess you are right! OK THE 420… I mean the NEXT CONTESTANT!!”

Then I stepped a step closer to becoming the king of the world! After that I went to see what magic Chris got.

“Hey Chris.”

“What do you want, Gullible?”

“I just wanted to know about your magic!”

“Whatever it is better than yours!”

Then he sprung his arms and created a circle of something and the same thing at my backside!

“Throw something there, Gullible.”

“Ok.”

Then I threw a stick laying down at the floor.

And it went down the circle he had made

And now it hit my head!

Chris laughed out like a frickin’ mad man!

“What the heck was that for?”

“Well. Now you know my teleportation magic right?”

“DAMN YOU!!”

Then I rushed at chris and tried to fire him up with my flames.

But he managed to escape from it.

“So. Your magic is blue flames? It is quite impressive to be honest! BUT NOT AS STRONG AS ME!”

Then I threw a flame at him.

He created a portal and reflected it at me!

I dodged it and got at the  back of Chris as fast as possible using my flames for flight!

Then I threw the flames at Chris and he was lying on the floor like a frickin’ loser!

“You…. Are …. Strong. And also worthy of being  my rival.”

“Yeah. Thanks for everything, Chris.”

That was the first time he didn’t mention Gullible in the dialogue.

I became so happy!

“Let’s meet at the tournament then……….. Zuzka.”

“Huh??? Sure Chris!”

I think that he started respecting me!

And now, I went off to my home thinking to myself.

“My magic is cool and all. But Chris’s is better I think… Well, What can I say? He is awesome!!!”

And this is… the start of a great journey!
